                        To preserve the existence of life on earth, the protection and protection of water is very important because life without water is not possible.
                    </p><p>
                        As an exception to the entire universe, water helps in continuing life cycle on earth because the earth is the only planet where water and life exist.
                    </p><p>      
                        The need for water in our lifetime, so only we are responsible for protecting it. According to the operation of the United Nations, it has been found that girls in Rajasthan do not go to school because they have to travel long distances to bring water which spoils their entire day, so they do not get time for any other work is.
                        
                        According to the survey of National Crime Records Bureau, it has been recorded that about 16,632 farmers (2,369 women) have lost their lives by suicide, although 14.4% have happened due to drought.
                    </p><p>  
                        That is why we can say that due to illiteracy, suicides, fighting and other social issues in India and other developing countries, there is also a shortage of water.                        
                        In such areas of water scarcity, children of the future generation cannot achieve the right to live with their basic education and live happily.
                    </p><p>   
                        Being a responsible citizen of India, we should keep ourselves aware of all the problems of water shortage, so that we take all the pledges and come forward together for water conservation.
                        It is right to say that small efforts of all people can give a big result, such as drop-down, can become a pond, river, and ocean.
                    </p><p>   
                        We do not have to make extra efforts for water conservation, we only need to make some positive changes in our daily activities like after fixing the tap after every use, bucket for washing or bathing instead of fountains or pipe And use mugs. A small effort of lots of people can give a big positive result towards the water conservation campaign</p>
